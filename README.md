Hello friend! This should get you all set up with the scaffolding for a website that runs on a local server using JavaScript(with Node.js and Express), HTML + CSS.

Here are some instructions for running this starter code. We're going to be using a command-line interface. (I'm writing this from the perspective of a Mac user using Terminal (zsh). If you're a Windows user, you might use Powershell. If you use Visual Studio Code, you might find this page helpful.)

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
Once you've got it, navigate to the directory (ex: $ cd starter-code)

2. Make sure you have Node and npm installed.
Check to see if you can run $ node -v and $ npm -v (My versions are v16.15.0 for node and 8.10.0 for npm.)

3. Install the Express module using npm.
ex: $ npm install express

4. Run the starter app using Node:
ex: $ node App.js

You should see the message Server is running on http://localhost:8000

If you instead see an error message like Error: Cannot find module 'express' -- see step 3.

5. View your website
Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to this URL: http://localhost:8000/

You should see a delicious website! Nice!

6. Make it your own!
Here's the file directory of this repository.

Edit the HTML files and the CSS stylesheet to make them your own!

Edit App.js if you want to change how pages route to one another, e.g. after adding new pages or renaming your HTML files.
